# RESTful_Blog_Application

A blog web application created using Node.js, MongoDB, HTML5, CSS3, Semantic UI, and embedded JavaScript. The main page shows all blogs, a button allows for new blog creation, and when viewing a blog you can edit and delete. MongoDB is used to create an object to hold blog information on the web application. 

The "RESTful.html" file included displays the RESTful routes used in this project.
